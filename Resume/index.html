  <h5>March 2020 - Present </h5>
  <p>As a production assistant, I have worked multiple positions on our staff for multiple sports across the shortened 2020 spring season, as well as the jam-packed 2021 winter and spring seasons. This includes being on graphics for multiple Maryland Men’s Lacrosse, Women’s Lacrosse, Men’s Soccer, and Women’s Soccer games and running a camera during Men’s Soccer and Baseball games.</p>

  <h5>March 2021-Present</h5>
  <p>This spring, I was also able to work as a color commentator for the Maryland Women’s Soccer team for two of their games in College Park this spring through our BTN Student U, and hope to not only continue commentating for the women’s team this fall but the men’s team as well.</p>

  <h3>Camp Counselor</h3>
  <h4>Graydon Pool Day Camp, Ridgewood NJ</h4>
  <h5>July 2019 - August 2019</h5>
  <p>As a counselor of around 30 third and fourth graders, I helped in everything from signing my group up for certain activities around the camp, taking attendance every morning, going swimming with the group, and making sure each kid was dropped off and picked up by a parent or guardian every morning and afternoon.</p>

  <h3>U.S. Soccer Federation Accredited Coach, Level F License</h3>
  <h4>U.S. Soccer Federation</h4>
  <h5>June 2015 - Present</h5>
  <p>Through a fully online course with the United States Soccer Federation, I was able to obtain my National Level F coaching license, which has allowed me to help assist head coaches in my area with training sessions, as well as run my own private training sessions over multiple summers with individuals or small groups.</p>
